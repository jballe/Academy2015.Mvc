note:
Sitecore has made some smaller inventions to make this fit with the rest of the product.

Most is around fitting this into the rendering engine.
Sitecore mentions this as the "automatic way", it works immediate that you insert a rendering and it works as usual
 
Model and View renderings is a way to insert stuff with limited amount of code, my opinion is that this is good for demos to show how easy it is but not usuable in the real world.
Our recommendation is that we stick with controller renderings, it is consistent and closer to standard ASP.Net MVC.
