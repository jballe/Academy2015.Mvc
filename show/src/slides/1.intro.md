## Separation of concerns

```uml
[<frame>MVP|
 [Presenter]->[Model]
 [Presenter]<-[View]
 [View]-->[Model]
]
[<frame>MVC|
 [Controller]->[Model]
 [Controller]<-[View]
 [View]-->[Model]
]
```

## How does this differ

```uml
[<frame>MVP|
 [Presenter]->[Model]
 [Presenter]<-[View]
 [<actor>Incoming Request]->[View]
]
[<frame>MVC|
 [Controller]->[Model]
 [Controller]<-[View]
 [<actor>Incoming Request]->[Controller]
]
```
